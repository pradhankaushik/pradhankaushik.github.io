					<p>I am a final year student of the BS-MS dual degree program at IISER Kolkata and will be graduating with both a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Geological Sciences in June 2021. Having spent my childhood in the countryside, I have always been fascinated to understand the planet Earth. It prompted me to major in Geological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata after being exposed to various science and mathematics disciplines for the first two years of the BS-MS dual degree program. 
            <br> <br>

            To broaden my skills, I have been working in the Prof Supriyo Mitra’s computational seismology lab since May 2019. During this time, I have worked on multiple projects and have enriched myself from the interaction with labmates through weekly research meetings and seismicity of the week talks. For the final year thesis, I am working on the Lg wave propagation across India and Eurasia. The work’s main endeavor is to seek answers to a fundamental question - what controls the efficiency of Lg wave propagation?
          </p>
            
            <p>Besides this, I have completed three fieldwork as a part of my coursework. The fieldwork at Singhbhum (one of India’s cratonic blocks) exposed me to geological mapping techniques and understanding the structural features. The fieldwork at the northwestern part of the Himalaya helped me to correlate the landscape and responsible climatic and tectonic factors. As a part of the Environmental Geosciences coursework, we visited the nearby wastewater treatment plant to understand various water filtering techniques.
            </p>
          <p>I am continuously learning from various workshops, seminars, and online resources to identify and solve challenging problems in earth sciences. For example, during June 2020, I attended a virtual summer school conducted by NCAR on “Artificial Intelligence for Earth System Science” and developed hand-on experience with applying machine learning to real-world Earth System Science datasets. I have also created email alerts from different journals to study the latest findings. These days, I am working as a teaching assistant for the seismology course to ensure seamless interaction between the students and faculty during this difficult time.</p>

              Earthquakes traveling through the interior of the globe are like so many messengers sent out to explore
              a new land. 
              The messages are constantly coming and seismologists are fast learning to read them.</blockquote>

                It takes an earthquake to remind us that we walk on the crust of an unfinished planet.

                It is a great philosophical breakthrough for geologists to accept catastrophe as a normal part of Earth history.
