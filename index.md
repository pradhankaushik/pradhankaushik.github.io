## About Me

I am a final year student of the BS-MS dual degree program at <a href="https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata</a>
majoring in Geological Sciences and will be graduating in July 2021. Through the application of knowledge gained from quantitative disciples and programming, I am working with <a href="https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~supriyomitra/" target="_blank">Prof. Supriyo Mitra</a> on seismology to understand the earthquakes, sub-surface through
which earthquakes propagate and interested in working on similar projects in seismology. 

I am looking for PhD programs to carry forward the research in seismology.

## Research

- **Project 1:** Back-projection technique to understand the spatio-temporal evolution of rupture.
- **Project 2:** High resolution crustal structure using ambient noise in the north western Himalaya.
- **Project 2:** Lg wave propagation and attenuation characteristics of the north western Himalaya.
